# Satoshi Hub - Cross-chain Testnet Hub

Welcome to **Satoshi Hub**, a production-grade "Cross-chain Testnet Hub" designed to simplify development across multiple EVM (and non-EVM) testnets.

## Project Structure

This is a monorepo managed with `pnpm` workspaces.

-   `/apps/backend`: The Node.js backend (NestJS).
-   `/apps/mobile`: The Flutter application for Web, iOS, and Android.
-   `/packages/sdk`: Shared TypeScript/Dart code, constants, and chain metadata.
-   `/infra`: Docker configurations for development (Postgres, Redis).
-   `/.github/workflows`: GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
